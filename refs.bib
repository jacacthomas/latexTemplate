%
% In a .bib file, there are many different types of entries:
% journal articles, books, websites, conference proceedings etc.
% The first thing to do when putting in a new item is to decide
% which type fits best. For each type, you need to specify a
% "key", which will allow you to cite it in your .tex file. For
% example, the first item below (an article) has the key "Chan2015".
%
% Below the key, each entry contains a certain number of "fields",
% such as "author", "year", "title" etc. Generally, the syntax is:
%
%   year = {2015}
%
% If you're going to put in more fields, put a comma after the 
% closing curly brace, and start on the next line. It doesn't matter
% what order your the fields into your entry, and bibtex ignores all
% white space. Note that for some entry types, certain fields are
% mandatory (e.g. for the "article" type, the "title" field is
% mandatory). All entries require a key.
%
% Like latex, bibtex is very picky about correct spelling and syntax.
% Often, a problem will be caused by incorrectly formatting your
% bibtex entries. If you keep getting stuck, it's worthwhile to
% copy and paste your .bib file into a "linter":
%
%   https://biblatex-linter.herokuapp.com/
%
% The linter will check to make sure everything's formatted correctly
% in your .bib file, and let you know if/where you're making any
% mistakes. If you want more quick tips on your .bib file, have a
% look at this cheat sheet:

%
% Remember that bibtex doesn't care about whitespace, so you can
% have as many tabs and newlines as you want. I set out my .bib
% files as below, to keep everything neat and easy to read. The
% entry types below are as follows:
% 
%   article
%   article
%   book
%   book
%   chapter in book
%   a website
%   a reference book
%   an article in a reference book
%   a miscellaneous entry
%

% an example article entry
@article{Chan2015,
    % for authors, just write their names as normal, separated by "and".
    % do this even if there are more than 2 authors, e.g. Mark Smith and
    % David Jones and Sam Davies
    author={Sheng-Ju Chan and Liang-Wen Lin},
    % use two pairs of curly braces (i.e. {{Title}}) for the title. if you
    % don't, the bibliography will make the title all lower-case, apart from
    % the first letter. if you do use two pairs of curly braces, then all
    % capitalisation will be preserved.
    title={{Massification of Higher Education in Taiwan: Shifting Pressure from 
    Admission to Employment}},
